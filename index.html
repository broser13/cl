					Through tools such as Hootsuite and Tweetdeck, I managed One Acre Fund’s Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn platforms and guided the distribution of the organization’s agricultural development content and news to a combined 100,000 followers. Weekly and monthly analyses of each platform’s performance enabled me to revise One Acre Fund’s posting strategy and increase new followers by an average of 100-150 on each platform per week. The expanded reach has helped the organization better engage with its target audience of East African professionals.

					I also have produced and distributed email newsletters to diverse audiences. At the World Federalist Movement, I worked with a team to research and compile news sources into a weekly email newsletter, which I then distributed through MailChimp to over 2,000 subscribers. Each week, I was also responsible for pitching and writing the lead story for the newsletter, which was an in-depth feature of the current events in a specific country. I also assisted in the development of One Acre Fund’s monthly organizational newsletter, where I promoted and copyedited a diverse array of materials, including current innovations work and stories of people impacted by the organization. I compiled reports based on the performance of these monthly newsletters, specifically click and open rates, which can be used to revise the newsletter strategy.

					Finally, I have worked extensively with web publishing on an array of content management systems, including WordPress, Squarespace, and Wagtail. I have also developed digital skills to expand my capacity in web publishing, such as HTML, CSS, and Adobe CC platforms such as Photoshop, InDesign, and Dreamweaver. At the World Federalist Movement, I drove the blog creation for the Center for the Development of International Law (CDIL), an affiliate program. I regularly created and published original international law and human rights blog posts for the CDIL website, which were then strategically posted on Twitter to maximize reach. At One Acre Fund, I assisted in the analysis and migration of the organization’s website, where I regularly published and wrote copy for over 100 blog posts through the Wagtail CMS. Additionally, I worked with the Communications Team to strategically create original blogs for the new website in line with One Acre Fund’s advocacy and recruitment goals. I was also responsible for proofreading and publishing event summaries and blog posts on Index on Censorship’s WordPress-powered site.
